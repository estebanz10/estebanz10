## Hi I'm Esteban ðŸ‘‹

I am 20 years old and started my Computer Science career 5 years ago through a basic python programming class. I took great interest on how software development integrated with data management, website tool building, and video game functionality thus starting my journey to learn more about Computer Science. 

This passion brought me to University of Illinois at Chicago where I've learned new languages, algorithms, and about how other people are handling their careers.
